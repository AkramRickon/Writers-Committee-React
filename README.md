# Build a writers committee

Project Link  [Writers Committee](https://writers-committee-rickon.netlify.app/) <br>
- I used Vanila CSS and React JS to build this site.
-  useState(), useEffect() react hook and self build json data have been used here.
-  In this site you will be able to build a writers committee based on your respective desire.
